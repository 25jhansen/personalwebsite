  <h3>bio</h3>
  <p>my school life isnt that bad and honestly im pretty excited with it. My faorite school subject is probably geography because i like maps. my least favorite one is probably gym because i have to do things none competitavley.</p>
  <p>in my personal life im fairly normal and i play a few sports. one of the things i like to do is work out (or at least try to). another thing i also like is video games becouse they are fun.</p>
